## 2025-01-19: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

FYXERAI-GEDS will be built as an AI-powered email assistant MVP targeting multi-account professionals with Django 4.2 + HTMX + Alpine.js architecture, focusing on email triage, AI-drafted replies, and meeting management.

### Context

The market opportunity exists for professionals managing multiple Gmail and Outlook accounts who spend 2.5+ hours daily on email management. Existing solutions either lack multi-account intelligence or require workflow disruption. The MVP approach allows rapid validation while building toward enterprise features.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **React-based SPA with Django REST API**
   - Pros: Modern architecture, better for complex interactions, mobile-ready
   - Cons: Increased complexity, longer development time, requires JavaScript expertise

2. **Full Agent OS Standard Stack (Django 5.0+ with React)**
   - Pros: Aligns with Agent OS defaults, future-proof architecture
   - Cons: Overkill for MVP, would require significant rework of existing planning

3. **Pure Django Templates without HTMX**
   - Pros: Simplest implementation, minimal JavaScript
   - Cons: Poor user experience, full page reloads, not competitive

### Rationale

**Django 4.2 + HTMX + Alpine.js** provides the optimal balance of:
- **Rapid Development**: Leverages existing Django expertise and minimizes frontend complexity
- **User Experience**: HTMX enables modern SPA-like interactions without heavy JavaScript frameworks
- **MVP Focus**: Allows quick iteration and validation without over-engineering
- **Extension Compatibility**: Lightweight architecture works well with browser extensions
- **Scaling Path**: Can evolve to more complex architecture as product grows

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster time to market with proven technology stack
- Lower development complexity and maintenance overhead
- Strong security model with Django's built-in protections
- Excellent integration with OAuth and external APIs
- Browser extension architecture well-suited to content script injection

**Negative:**
- Diverges from Agent OS standard React frontend (documented deviation)
- May require refactoring for complex interactive features in later phases
- Limited mobile responsiveness compared to React Native solutions

## 2025-01-19: Tech Stack Architecture Deviation

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Deviate from Agent OS standard tech stack (Django 5.0+ with React) in favor of Django 4.2 with HTMX + Alpine.js frontend architecture.

### Context

Agent OS defaults recommend Django 5.0+ with React frontend, but project requirements and existing planning favor a server-side rendering approach with progressive enhancement.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Full Agent OS Compliance**
   - Pros: Standards alignment, future compatibility
   - Cons: Requires complete architecture rework, delays MVP delivery

2. **Hybrid Approach (Django 5.0 + HTMX)**
   - Pros: Newer Django version, maintains HTMX benefits
   - Cons: Django 5.0 not yet fully validated for email integration requirements

### Rationale

The deviation is justified by:
- **Email-Specific Requirements**: Server-side email processing works better with Django templates + HTMX
- **Browser Extension Integration**: Alpine.js provides better content script compatibility than React
- **Development Speed**: Team expertise in Django 4.2 + HTMX accelerates delivery
- **MVP Constraints**: Complex SPA architecture unnecessary for initial feature set

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Maintains existing architectural planning and development momentum
- Optimal for email assistant use case and browser extension requirements
- Proven technology stack with lower risk profile

**Negative:**
- Creates maintenance divergence from Agent OS standards
- May require migration planning for future Agent OS compliance
- Limited access to React-based Agent OS tooling and components

## 2025-01-19: Security and Privacy Architecture

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Security Lead, Tech Lead, Compliance Team

### Decision

Implement enterprise-grade security from MVP launch with OAuth-only authentication, AES-256 encryption for stored tokens, and GDPR/HIPAA compliance patterns.

### Context

Email assistant applications handle highly sensitive personal and business communications, requiring robust security from day one rather than retrofitting security later.

### Rationale

- **Trust Requirements**: Email access requires highest user trust levels
- **Compliance Necessity**: Business users need GDPR/HIPAA compliance for adoption
- **OAuth Security**: Eliminates password storage and reduces attack surface
- **Future-Proofing**: Enterprise features require security foundation from MVP

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Enables enterprise customer acquisition from launch
- Reduces security debt and retrofit costs
- Builds user trust and confidence in platform

**Negative:**
- Increases initial development complexity and timeline
- Higher hosting and encryption costs from MVP stage
- More complex testing and validation requirements
