# Tech Stack Document

This document explains, in simple terms, the technology choices for your FYXERAI-like email assistant MVP. It walks through each layer of the system so that anyone — even without a technical background — can understand why each tool was chosen and what role it plays.

## 1. Frontend Technologies
These are the tools and libraries powering what you see and interact with in your browser and extensions.

- **Django Templates & HTMX**  
  • Django’s built-in template system keeps your pages simple and fast.  
  • HTMX lets you update parts of a page (like inbox updates) without a full reload, giving a snappy feel.

- **Alpine.js**  
  A lightweight JavaScript library for small interactive bits (dropdowns, toggles, inline editors) without the weight of a full framework.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  A utility-first style toolkit that lets you build a clean, modern UI (inspired by Material Design) quickly by composing simple CSS classes.

- **ShadCN UI**  
  A set of pre-designed, accessible UI components (buttons, cards, inputs) that fit right into your Tailwind-based design.

- **Browser Extensions & Add-ins**  
  • **Chrome Extension** and **Edge Extension** hook into Gmail and Outlook web interfaces to show category tags, AI-draft buttons, and quick actions right in your inbox.  
  • **Outlook Desktop Add-in** offers similar controls if you prefer the Outlook desktop client.

## 2. Backend Technologies
This layer does the heavy lifting: talking to email providers, running AI models, and storing data.

- **Django (Python)**  
  The main server framework. It handles user logins, settings, and talks to databases and third-party services.

- **Databases**  
  • **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)** is the primary database for storing user profiles, message metadata, tone profiles, and audit logs.  
  • **Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)** is an interchangeable option if you prefer Google Cloud’s managed database service.

- **Object Storage**  
  **AWS S3** holds larger files like meeting audio recordings and transcripts in a secure, durable way.

- **APIs & Background Tasks**  
  • **OpenAI API** (or equivalent LLM provider) generates reply drafts, summaries, and meeting notes.  
  • **Custom REST endpoints** in Django let your browser extension and web dashboard communicate with the server.  
  • (Optionally) a background task runner like Celery can process large jobs (email classification, transcription) without blocking user actions.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment
How the system is hosted, updated, and kept running smoothly.

- **Version Control**  
  **Git** with a **GitHub** repository keeps your code history organized and makes collaboration easy.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**  
  **GitHub Actions** automatically run tests and deploy new code whenever you merge changes, so updates reach production without manual steps.

- **Hosting & Scaling**  
  • **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** or **AWS ECS/Fargate** can run your Django application in containers, scaling up or down based on load.  
  • **Auto-Scaling Groups** and **Load Balancers** in AWS ensure your service stays available even if traffic spikes.

- **Monitoring & Logging**  
  **Amazon CloudWatch** tracks performance metrics (CPU, memory, response times) and alerts you if something goes wrong.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations
Services that connect your assistant to email, calendars, meetings, chats, and CRMs.

- **Email & Calendar Access**  
  • **Google Workspace APIs (Gmail, Calendar, OAuth)**  
  • **Microsoft Graph API (Outlook email, Calendar, OAuth)**

- **AI and Transcription**  
  • **OpenAI API** for drafting and summarization  
  • **Zoom API**, **Google Meet API**, **Microsoft Teams API** for joining meetings, recording, and transcription

- **Chat & Notifications**  
  **Slack API** and optionally **Microsoft Teams API** deliver summaries, drafts, and approval prompts right into your team chat.

- **CRM Integrations**  
  **Salesforce API** and **HubSpot API** let you pull contact details and log communications to personalize replies automatically.

- **Storage & Code Management**  
  • **AWS S3** for large files  
  • **GitHub** for source code and issue tracking

- **Developer Tools**  
  **Cursor** and **Claude Code** are AI-powered IDE helpers that speed up coding by suggesting snippets and understanding your codebase in real time.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations
Outline of safeguards and speed-ups built into the system.

- **Authentication & Authorization**  
  • Secure **OAuth** flows let users connect Gmail and Outlook without sharing passwords.  
  • Django’s session management (or JWT tokens) controls who can see which data.

- **Data Protection**  
  • **TLS encryption** for all data in transit.  
  • **Encryption at rest** for databases and S3 buckets.  
  • Role-based access controls inside AWS to limit who (and what service) can read sensitive data.

- **Compliance & Privacy**  
  Designed to meet enterprise standards (ISO 27001, SOC 2 Type 2) and support GDPR or HIPAA requirements if you choose.

- **Performance Optimizations**  
  • **HTMX** for partial page updates, reducing full-page reloads.  
  • **Auto-scaling** infrastructure ensures quick response times under heavy load.  
  • **Background task queues** keep long-running jobs (like transcription) off the main request path.

- **Reliability & Resilience**  
  • **Retry logic** and **circuit breakers** if external APIs (Google, Microsoft) experience hiccups.  
  • **99.9% uptime target** backed by multi-AZ deployment in AWS.

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary
Your MVP’s technology choices are designed to be:

- **Familiar & Fast to Build**:  Django with HTMX, Alpine.js, and Tailwind lets you deliver a clean, interactive interface without a heavy front-end framework.
- **Secure & Compliant**:  OAuth for account access, TLS everywhere, plus enterprise-grade certifications if you grow beyond personal use.
- **Scalable & Reliable**:  AWS managed services (RDS, S3, ECS) with auto-scaling, monitoring, and CI/CD pipelines ensure smooth operation as you add more inboxes, users, or advanced AI features.
- **Extensible**:  Clear REST APIs, webhooks, and a plugin-style approach to integrations (CRM, chat, transcription) mean you can add new services down the line.

This stack aligns with your goals of replicating Fyxer AI’s core features—email triage, AI-draft replies, meeting notes, and scheduling—while keeping the system lean, maintainable, and ready for future growth.
