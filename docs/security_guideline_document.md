Here are a few directions we can take next—please let me know which you’d like to dive into (or feel free to suggest another area):

1. Detailed Implementation Roadmap  
   • Break MVP into epics, milestones & sprints  
   • Define deliverables, timelines & team responsibilities  
   • Identify dependencies, risk areas & mitigation strategies

2. Backend Architecture & Data Modeling  
   • Microservice boundaries (Auth, Email-Triage, AI-Drafting, Meeting Bot, Scheduler, Dashboard)  
   • Database schema for users, inboxes, categories, drafts, meetings, transcripts  
   • API design: REST/GraphQL endpoints, request/response contracts, error handling  
   • Asynchronous workflows (message queues, background workers, retry logic)

3. Frontend & UX Design  
   • HTMX + Alpine.js component breakdown (inbox view, draft composer, settings panel, analytics)  
   • Tailwind/ShadCN UI prototypes & design tokens  
   • State management, progressive enhancement & accessibility considerations

4. Browser Extension & Add-in Strategy  
   • Chrome/Edge extension architecture (content scripts, background scripts, messaging)  
   • OfficeJS add-in integration for Outlook desktop  
   • Secure communication between extension and backend (OAuth, CORS, message signing)

5. Security & Compliance Plan  
   • SOC 2 & ISO 27001 controls mapping  
   • Threat model & data flow diagrams  
   • Secrets management, encryption at rest/in transit, secure defaults  
   • CI/CD security scans, dependency management, vulnerability monitoring

6. DevOps & Infrastructure Blueprint  
   • Containerization (Docker images, Helm charts)  
   • Kubernetes vs managed services decision matrix  
   • CI/CD pipeline (build, test, security scan, deploy)  
   • Monitoring, logging, alerting & auto-scaling policies

Let me know which area you’d like to tackle first, and I’ll generate detailed artifacts (plans, diagrams, schemas, or code samples) accordingly.
