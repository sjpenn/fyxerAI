# Phase 2: Frontend Development Setup

## Overview

Implement the frontend foundation for FYXERAI-GEDS by setting up Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, and ShadCN UI components within the Django framework. This phase establishes the styling system, JavaScript interactivity layer, and responsive dashboard UI that will support the email assistant's web interface.

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories
- **As a user**, I want to access a modern, responsive web dashboard so that I can manage my email accounts from any device
- **As a user**, I want to toggle between light and dark themes so that I can use the interface comfortably in different lighting conditions
- **As a user**, I want to see placeholder email account cards so that I understand where my connected accounts will appear
- **As a developer**, I want a configured build system so that I can efficiently develop and deploy frontend assets

### Secondary User Stories
- **As a user**, I want fast page interactions without full reloads so that the interface feels responsive
- **As a developer**, I want reusable UI components so that the interface remains consistent and maintainable

## Spec Scope

### In Scope for Phase 2
1. **CSS Framework Setup**
   - Install and configure Tailwind CSS v3 with JIT mode
   - Set up PostCSS and Autoprefixer
   - Configure Tailwind to scan Django templates
   - Create base CSS structure with custom design tokens

2. **JavaScript Framework Setup**
   - Install Alpine.js v3 for reactive components
   - Configure Alpine.js initialization
   - Create Alpine store for global state management
   - Set up basic Alpine components for interactivity

3. **UI Component Library**
   - Install and configure ShadCN UI components adapted for Alpine.js
   - Create base component structure
   - Implement card, button, and modal components
   - Establish component naming and usage conventions

4. **Django Template System**
   - Create responsive base template (`base.html`)
   - Implement dashboard template with placeholder content
   - Configure Django static files serving
   - Set up template inheritance structure

5. **Theme System**
   - Implement dark/light theme toggle using Alpine.js
   - Configure Tailwind dark mode variants
   - Create theme persistence with localStorage
   - Apply consistent theming across all components

6. **Basic Browser Extension Scaffold**
   - Create Chrome extension manifest v3 structure
   - Implement basic content script for Gmail/Outlook
   - Set up extension popup interface
   - Configure extension-to-backend communication foundation

### Core Deliverables
- Fully configured Tailwind CSS build system
- Alpine.js components with theme switching
- ShadCN UI component library integration
- Responsive Django templates with dashboard layout
- Chrome extension manifest and basic structure
- Static file serving configuration
- Development workflow documentation

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly Excluded
- Backend API endpoints (reserved for Phase 3)
- OAuth authentication flows (reserved for Phase 3) 
- Email data processing and categorization (reserved for Phase 3)
- Database models beyond Django defaults (reserved for Phase 3)
- Production deployment configuration (reserved for Phase 5)
- Advanced Alpine.js components beyond theme toggle and basic interactivity
- Email content rendering or manipulation
- Meeting transcription interfaces
- Complex state management beyond basic Alpine stores

### Future Phase Dependencies
- Email account connection UI depends on Phase 3 OAuth implementation
- Dynamic email content requires Phase 3 API endpoints
- Extension functionality requires Phase 3 backend integration
- Production optimizations require Phase 5 deployment setup

## Expected Deliverable

A fully functional frontend foundation that includes:

### Visual Requirements
- **Dashboard Layout**: Clean, modern interface with sidebar navigation and main content area
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design that works on tablets, desktops, and mobile devices
- **Theme System**: Seamless dark/light mode switching with user preference persistence
- **Component Library**: Consistent design system using ShadCN UI adapted for Alpine.js
- **Loading States**: Smooth transitions and loading indicators for dynamic content

### Technical Requirements
- **Build Performance**: Tailwind CSS compilation under 2 seconds in development
- **JavaScript Footprint**: Alpine.js bundle size under 50KB minified
- **Browser Compatibility**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for color contrast and keyboard navigation
- **Page Load Speed**: Initial dashboard load under 3 seconds on 3G connection

### Browser Extension Requirements
- **Manifest v3**: Chrome extension that loads without security warnings
- **Content Script**: Successfully injects into Gmail and Outlook web interfaces
- **Communication**: Basic message passing between extension and Django backend
- **UI Integration**: Non-intrusive overlay elements that don't break existing UI

### Validation Criteria
1. Dashboard loads successfully at `http://localhost:8005/`
2. Theme toggle works and persists across browser sessions
3. All UI components render consistently across supported browsers
4. Extension loads successfully in Chrome developer mode
5. Tailwind CSS builds without errors and includes all necessary components
6. Alpine.js components initialize without JavaScript errors
7. Static files serve correctly in Django development server
8. Mobile responsive design validates on devices 320px width and above
