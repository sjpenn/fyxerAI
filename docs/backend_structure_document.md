I’m all set to draft the detailed, step-by-step implementation plan for your FyxerAI-style MVP.  

Before we dive in, just to confirm:

• Would you like high-level milestones only, or a breakdown into individual development tasks?  
• Do you have any hard launch dates or sprint lengths in mind?  
• Should we include estimates (e.g., story points or hours) per task?

Let me know your preferences, and I’ll lay out the tasks, dependencies, and timelines accordingly.
