# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Django PostgreSQL Setup
> Created: 2025-08-19
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Establish the foundational Django 5.latest web application with PostgreSQL database integration to serve as the backend infrastructure for the FYXERAI-GEDS email assistant. This setup will provide the core framework for user management, email data storage, OAuth integration, and AI-powered features.

## User Stories

### Developer Setup Story

As a developer, I want to clone the project and have a working Django + PostgreSQL development environment in under 10 minutes, so that I can immediately begin implementing email assistant features without configuration overhead.

The developer experience should include automated virtual environment setup, database initialization, sample data loading, and verification that all core systems are functioning correctly through a simple test suite.

### Production Deployment Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the Django application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk with PostgreSQL RDS integration, so that the email assistant has a scalable and reliable production infrastructure.

The deployment process should include environment variable configuration, database migrations, static file serving, and health check endpoints that verify both application and database connectivity.

### Email Data Management Story

As the email assistant system, I want to store and retrieve user email accounts, messages, and categorization data efficiently, so that multi-account email management and AI processing can operate with sub-2-second response times.

The database schema should support multiple OAuth-connected accounts per user, email metadata storage, and optimized queries for email categorization and draft generation workflows.

## Spec Scope

1. **Django 5.latest Project Structure** - Complete Django application setup with proper settings configuration for development and production environments
2. **PostgreSQL Database Integration** - Database connection, migration system, and optimized configuration for email data storage
3. **Core Application Models** - User management, email accounts, and foundational data models for the email assistant
4. **Development Environment** - Virtual environment, dependency management, and local development server configuration
5. **Testing Framework** - Django test suite setup with database testing patterns and continuous integration preparation

## Out of Scope

- OAuth integration implementation (separate specification)
- Email API connections to Gmail/Outlook (separate specification)  
- AI integration with OpenAI API (separate specification)
- Frontend HTMX templates and Alpine.js components (separate specification)
- Browser extension development (separate specification)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional Django 5.latest application accessible at http://localhost:8000 with working admin interface
2. PostgreSQL database with applied migrations and ability to create/read user and email account records
3. Comprehensive test suite with 85%+ code coverage and all tests passing via `python manage.py test`
