# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a new user first visits the application, they land on a simple welcome page that explains the core benefits of the AI email assistant. From here, the user can choose to install the browser extension for Chrome or Edge, or navigate directly to the web dashboard. To begin using the service, the user clicks a prominent Sign Up button. They are presented with options to connect via their Google account, their Microsoft account, or with a local email and password combination. When the user selects Google or Microsoft, an OAuth consent screen appears to request permission for reading and organizing email messages, accessing calendars, and managing labels or folders. After granting access, the user is returned to the onboarding wizard. If they choose the email and password option, they fill out a registration form, confirm their email address via a verification link, and then proceed into the application. A Forgot Password link is available on the login screen to reset credentials through a secure email link. Once signed in, the user can sign out at any time using the profile menu in the top right corner of the web dashboard or the extension toolbar icon.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
Upon successful sign-in, the user arrives at the unified dashboard, which serves as the central hub for all email and meeting activities. The top of the screen displays tabs for each connected account alongside an "All Inboxes" view, allowing the user to switch quickly between individual inboxes or see every message at once. Directly beneath the tabs, a large search bar invites the user to search by sender, subject, or custom keywords. On the left side, a vertical navigation pane offers links to the email overview, meeting summaries, analytics on time saved, and the settings area. The main content area shows a paginated list of messages filtered by the currently selected category. Category filters labeled To Respond, FYI, Marketing, and Spam appear as clickable labels above the message list, and each category shows a real-time count of unread or unsorted messages. A help icon in the header provides quick access to documentation and troubleshooting tips.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
### Email Triage and Categorization Flow
As new messages arrive, the system automatically classifies each email using the machine-learning engine and updates the message list in near real time. When the user clicks the email overview link in the sidebar, they see incoming messages grouped by category. If the user disagrees with an automatic classification, they can drag the email from one category to another or use an inline dropdown to reassign it. After the user makes a manual correction, the AI adjusts its personal model so that similar messages will be categorized correctly in the future. Messages sorted into Spam or Marketing remain hidden from the default view but can be unhidden through a toggle above the message list.

### AI-Powered Draft Generation Flow
When the AI determines an email requires a response, a draft icon appears next to the message subject. By clicking this icon, the user triggers a call to the OpenAI API, which generates a reply draft in the user’s tone. The draft text is displayed inline beneath the original message and is simultaneously saved to the provider’s Drafts folder. The user can edit the draft directly in the dashboard or open the native email compose window to make changes. Once satisfied, the user clicks Send Reply, which uses the Gmail or Outlook API to send the message from their own account. If the user wishes to draft a reply to any other message, they can open the command palette in the extension, type a prompt to request a draft for that email, and the assistant will generate it on demand.

### Meeting Notes and Scheduling Assistant Flow
By navigating to the meeting view in the sidebar, the user sees a list of upcoming calendar events drawn from Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook. For each video call, the user flips an Enable Notes toggle to invite the AI bot to join the meeting. During the call, the assistant joins as a hidden participant, records audio, and transcribes the conversation using a speech-to-text service. After the meeting, the user receives an email summary containing key points, action items, and a draft follow-up message. In the scheduling section, the assistant analyzes participants’ free/busy information across time zones and suggests optimal meeting times. The user clicks a suggested slot, reviews the invite details, and clicks Send Invitation to schedule the meeting in all connected calendars.

### Native Email Interface Integration Flow
When the user opens Gmail or Outlook on the web with the browser extension installed, the assistant overlays category tags and AI draft icons directly within the inbox interface. Hovering over a message subject reveals quick-action buttons for categorizing, summarizing, or generating replies without leaving the native email client. For desktop Outlook users, a dedicated add-in adds similar controls in the ribbon menu, allowing the user to draft replies or file messages into categories with a single click.

### Unified Web Dashboard Navigation
From any page in the extension or web dashboard, the user can click the dashboard icon to return to the unified inbox view. The meeting summaries link brings the user to a chronological list of all meeting notes and follow-up drafts. An analytics link displays aggregate statistics such as messages categorized, drafts generated, and estimated time saved. Every action panel includes a breadcrumb trail or header link so that the user never loses context and can always navigate back to the primary dashboard.

## Settings and Account Management
In the settings area, the user can manage connected accounts, personal profile details, and security preferences. Under Accounts, the user adds or removes Gmail and Outlook connections, re-authenticates expired tokens, or disconnects an account entirely. The Preferences section lets the user toggle categories on or off, adjust how Marketing and Spam are handled, and set their preferred tone style as formal, casual, or custom. A Theme tab allows selection between dark and light modes and the choice of an accent color. Integration toggles enable or disable Slack or Microsoft Teams notifications and CRM connections. Under Billing, the user enters payment details, upgrades to the Pro plan for multiple inbox support, or views invoice history. Each settings page includes a Save Changes button and a Cancel link that returns the user to the dashboard.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If the user submits invalid credentials during sign-in, an inline error message appears above the login form prompting them to retry or reset their password. During OAuth flows, if the user denies permissions, the application shows a permissions error page explaining which features will be unavailable and offers a Retry button. In cases of network loss or API timeouts, a banner at the top of the interface notifies the user that connectivity is interrupted and queues any categorization or draft requests until the connection is restored. If the AI service returns an error or rate limit, the draft button is disabled temporarily and displays a tooltip asking the user to try again in a few seconds. Any unrecoverable errors redirect to a friendly error page with a Support link to report issues.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From the moment a user signs up and connects their accounts, they are guided through a streamlined onboarding to establish their tone and preferences. Once onboarded, the user spends most of their time on the unified dashboard reviewing categorized emails, generating and sending AI-drafted replies, and toggling meeting note-taking features. The browser extension and Outlook add-in keep the assistant’s capabilities within the user’s native email environment, while the web dashboard offers deeper analytics and configuration controls. Settings allow personalization of categories, appearance, integrations, and billing options. Error states are handled gracefully with clear messages and retry opportunities. Over time, the user enjoys a consistently clean inbox, faster reply drafting, and automated meeting summaries, fulfilling the goal of a reliable AI executive assistant that sits atop existing Gmail or Outlook workflows.
